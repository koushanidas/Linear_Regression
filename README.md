# Linear_Regression
We perform a hypothesis testing using Multi Linear Regression in R of Airbnb rentals of NYC 2019 data. In the code we show dependencies of Prices (dependent variable) with multiple other factors like location, availibility throughout the year, customer prefernces etc. The r squared value tells us the relationship between the factors. W also use t test and F test to show if the prices of Brooklyn vary extensively from prices of Queens in 2019 or not.
